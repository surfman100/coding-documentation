Advantages of the Monolith

- build
- test

Disadvantages of the Monolith

- The app has become so overwhelmingly complicated that no single person understands it.
- You fear making changes - each change has unintended and costly side effects.
- New features/fixes become tricky, time-consuming, and expensive to implement.
- Each release becomes as small as possible and requires a full deployment of the entire application.
- One unstable component can crash the entire system.
- New technologies and frameworks aren't an option.
- It's difficult to implement agile delivery methodologies.
- Architectural erosion sets in as the code base deteriorates with never-ending "quick fixes."
- Finally, the consultants come in and tell you to rewrite it.
