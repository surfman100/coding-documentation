Learn page is [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-database-administrator-associate/?practice-assessment-type=certification)

## Migrations
Tools
- Azure Database Migration Service (large migrations, fully featured)
- Data Migration Assistant (useful, recommend Migration Service )


| Type | Pros | How | Cons | 
| ---- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Azure Migrate | source remains online and operational | |
| Transaction replication | minimize downtime where no Always On. | Subscriber(target) request publication. Point new connections at Subcriber. |
| Log Shipping | Minimal interuption, less setup | continous backups of transaction logs | 
| Detach / Attach DB | Larger DBs | Store DB in Azure Storage |
| Convert to VM | want to retain specific setup | | 
| Import/Export wizard / Bacpac | | use multiple SQLPackage commands to parallelise | Can't restore one table, import is to a clean DB |
| Bulk Copy | | need to know schema and data types | 
| Azure Data Factory | | |
| Windows Import/Export Service | Hugh transfers | Shipped hard drives |

## SQL Types
| Type | Tier | Pros | Features | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Azure SQL | PAAS | low administration, migration to cloud ease | more backup features, automatic |
| Managed SQL | PAAS | | cross DB queries, CLR, System DB access, SQL Agent | shares sames code base as Azure SQL. Backup to blob |
| SQL on VM | IAAS | Bring in out of Cloud servers using ARC |

- Azure SQL Purchasing Model
  - **vCore-based**. Service Tiers:
      - GP. (1 replica, no read scale replicas)
      - Business Critical (several secondary replicas). *HA*
      - Hyperscale (allows several secondary replicas)
    - Hyperscale new Tech, once converted you can't go back. High Perf, instant backup / scaling. moves beyoud standard limiations. Cost marginally more than Azure SQL db.
  - **DTU-based**. Service Tiers:
      - Basic
      - Standard
      - Premium (managed db does not support this option) *HA*
- Compute Tier
  - Provisioned
  - Serverless (good for test and development: auto scale, auto pause)

- Features
  - Elastic Query
  - Predict for Machine Learning
  - Table paritioning -> when large rowcount impacts queries. Use of partition functions
  - Data Compression -> compress indexes, more data on the 8kb page, less I/O
  - Elastic Pool -> good option for multitenant databases. Scaling happens with very little interruption

- SQL on VM
  - types of disk
  - IaaS agent:
    - registers VM SQL on Azure (SQL Virtual Machines)
    - automates patching, backup etc
 
## Distaster Recovery
SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance 
Windows Server Failover Cluster
Azure Site Recovery is a low-cost solution that will perform block level replication of your Azure virtual machine -> good for web servers, not OLTP
Availability Sets (HA)
Always On availability groups (HA & DR) -> automatic failover of DB but not instance


## Automation

| Type | Pros | How | Cons | 
| ---- | ---- | --- | --- |
| SQL Agent | robust scheduling | | only SQL Server and Managed SQL Server |
| Elastic Jobs | Run TSQL across DBs |  | Limited? | requires its own DB. use job_executions to query |
| Azure Automation | Fully featured. Periodic jobs are low cost. | Functions, Logic Apps and more! | There's a lot to this area |
| Azure Policy | enforcement of standards | | |
